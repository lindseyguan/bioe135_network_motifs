# BioE 135 - Network Motif Analysis
Scripts for generating networks from RegulonDB data and conducting network motif analyses.

Motif clustering analyses were completed with Biocompute tools from @chofski on Github (https://github.com/BiocomputeLab/mctools/tree/master/mctools). The igraph isomorphism motif code for a feedforward loop is 7. 

Usage of Python scripts:
At this time, scripts process only RegulonDB-formatted text files to create graphs.
